<p>Peach has been created to participate in solving this problem: “how do we get Bitcoin retail’s adoption?”</p>
<p>We want to help as many individuals as possible to get access to the best money ever existed. A money that a central party can not devaluate,
because it has a fixed supply. A money that a central party can not censor, because you are the only one to own it. A money that a central party
can not discriminate, because you don’t need to ask permission to use it. And the most critical point, a money that a central party can not control
or modify, because Bitcoin uses an immutable accounting ledger.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is money for free people. We believe that every single human being has the right to choose which money he uses to store his wealth, the
result of his work, his time and energy.</p>
<p>Peach’s mission is to do its part to contribute to Bitcoin’s adoption in the hands of the people.</p>
<p>Peach was born from the minds of Bitcoin Maximalists. People who believe in the natural convergence of the market towards the best money
available. People who believe p2p markets are the real markets, and who want to make the process of buying/selling bitcoin and self-custody it
as easy as possible, even for the ones who have never used a wallet before.</p>
<p>As for the rest, our story is cliché. It started on Bitcoin Twitter and a couple of peachy shots later… here we are!</p>
