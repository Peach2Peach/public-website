# How to buy and sell Bitcoin with cash using Peach

Disclaimer: The process to add a new meetup as a payment method is the same for both buyer and seller. Once the meetup is added, both
counterparts need to follow the usual Peach process to publish their trade and find a trading partner.

## Intro

Dear peachies, in today’s tutorial we’ll explain how Peach users can trade with cash using the Peach app.

Peach provides “meeting points” for users where it is recommended to trade with cash, for security reasons. This meeting points are already
existing Bitcoin meetups in different cities around the world, which are held at least once a month, so users can publish their cash trades before
attending the meetup, and once they are there, trade in a secure and safe environment.

You can check out the different meetups that are already using our cash feature in our “[For Meetups](/for-meetups/)” page.

our [For Meetups](/for-meetups/) page and fill out the form.

## Let’s trade!

Alright, no more boring explanations, let’s get to the tutorial.

When a user wants to buy Bitcoin with cash on Peach, this steps need to be followed to publish an offer and find a match:

0. Open the Peach app 😉

1. When in the **BUY** or **SELL** tab, the user will need to choose between remote / meetups payment method. In this case, when we tap on
meetups, we’ll see we can “**add a new meetup**”.

2. Once we’ve clicked on “add new meetup”, a full list of the available **Countries** will appear on the app. Choose your desired country, and
then you’ll see the full list of **meetups** available in that country.

4. After adding it, you’ll see a notification warning you to trade responsibly with cash, as Peach cannot be the responsible in case something
goes wrong with those trades.

5. After accepting it, you’ll have added successfully the meetup into your payment methods list, and you’ll be able to proceed with publishing
the buy/sell offer as you’d normally do with any other payment method in Peach.
