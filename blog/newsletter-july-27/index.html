<p>Hello Peaches! 🍑</p>
<p>How's the summer treating you so far? August is just two streets away, and the chill months will be ending soon. But that doesn't need to be bad at all, especially if you'll be attending any of the conferences that are happening during this second half of the year.
In our case, we'll be attending the most OG Bitcoin conference out there, BHB in Riga, the first week of September. We won't be paneling there, but we've got some surprise announcements prepared for the conference! 👀</p>
<p>Make sure to come talk to any of the team if you want to receive some cool Peach merch 👕</p>

<p>Anyway, you don't need to wait until Riga cause TODAY we've also got some good news to share with you. Let's get to it!</p>
<p>First, we've decided to add all our previous newsletters to our website's blog section. This way, new users will be able to see the path we've been taking, and the growth of the project over time.</p>
<p>But especially, for our privacy lovers, you won't need to be subscribed to our mailing list (which is handled by a 3d party provider, Brevo) to read them anymore!</p>
<p>On the technical side, we've been shipping some important features lately. In case you've missed them, here is a brief list:</p>
<pre><code>You can now accelerate your stuck transactions with RBF
Fund sell offers directly from your peach wallet
Modify your premium without cancelling the offer
Liquid L-USDT
Peach in ITALIANO 🇮🇹
</code></pre>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<pre><code>LN swaps ⚡
Filter your offers according to your preferences
Peach in DEUSTCH 🇩🇪 &amp; GREEK 🇬🇷
</code></pre>
<p>We're always trying to listen to the community and (re)prioritize our goals, so in case you think there's a feature you'd really like to see implemented, please let us know by filling out this form (also, if you'd like to help translate the app into a certain language).
As u know, peaches are soft on the outside but have a strong core.
Even if it's not seen, we've also been working to improve our internal systems, and thanks to it, we're sure they'll be a huge help to all of you when trading and taking decisions about the market!</p>

<p>How do we create the easiest and most sovereign way to buy bitcoin out there?</p>
<p>We're asking you, bitcoin freaks, cause you are now suffering what will be a problem for a huge percentage of the population in a few years.</p>
<p>However, we'll be forever grateful if you tell your no-coiner friends, uncles, and grandmas to use Peach whenever they ask you how that magic internet money is going. They have the BEST feedback out there as they can take a fresh look at the app and bitcoin in general.</p>
<p>And in case they don't understand why they should be using Peach instead of any other shitcoin casino, tell them we've just published our 4th chapter of the Why P2P series! This time, focused on building trust between peers! You can find the post in our blog, medium, or simply by clicking on the button below!</p>
<p>P.S. As you may know, peach is a startup working on a Bitcoin standard, creating the easiest and most sovereign way to buy and sell Bitcoin. Currently, we're on our way to raising a seed round, so if you know anyone who'd be interested in investing in Peach, get in touch with us!</p>
