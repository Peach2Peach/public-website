# Integrate your meetup in Peach

<!--[intro]-->
Are you the kind of Bitcoiner who likes to travel all around, but always need to sell some corn for cash everywhere you go?

Do you jump from meetup to meetup as an excuse to visit the world?

Or simply, you just hesitate on publishing offers in public telegram groups to avoid being doxxed?

We've got the solution for you.
Peach app includes **anonymous Cash Trades**.

We are **partnering with meetups all over the world** to facilitate safe & secure places to trade Bitcoin with cash.

If you are a meetup organizer and would like to get your meetup into Peach, fill the contact form below and we'll get back to you to proceed with the integration!

If your meetup is eligible\* to be integrated inside our app, we'll get back in touch with you to ask for the final details.

<small>*only Europe and [accepted currencies](/how-it-works/#payment) are eligible right now. In the future we will be expanding to other zones in the world, so don't hesitate in applying even if your meetup does not comply with all the requisites.</small>
