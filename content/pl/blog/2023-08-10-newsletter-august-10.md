Hello Peaches! üçë

After last year's 3AC, Luna, Celsius and FTX collapses, it seemed like the world was slowly healing and recovering common sense. Unfortunately, it has taken just 1 year to get back to hype frenzies driven by dystopian characters, which no one really knows where they came from.
Even if it seems extremely weird to have a new super villain in the scene with almost the same name as the previous one (Sam ALTman vs Sam BANKman, I mean... wtf), don't get caught in their friendly talks about how they want to "help the world become a better place".
As a wise man once said...

Guys, make sure if Peach ever asks you to scan your iris to use our services... We've been compromised and you should gtfo asap!
We're commited to provide plebs an easy way to buy and sell bitcoin via their smartphone, without promising stupid airdrops, yield or whatever this shitcoin marketing people come up with next. We're sure anyone who puts enough proof of work into studying how money works, will end up stacking as much sats as possible, and ditch all those casino coins.
Ok, enough ranting about trivial things, let's get to the really important news...
We've been occupied preparing everything for this September, as Riga Baltic Honeybadger is just a couple weeks away, and we couldn't be more excited.
BHB is special for us as we launched Peach Bitcoin there 1 year ago, and we are preparing some BIG announcements for this year's edition. Peach 0.3 is arriving, and it brings huge news with it.

Seeing the evolution of Peach in just 1 year is astonishing from our PoV, and we'd love to share that 1y anniversary with all the fellow plebs who will be attending the conference.
Do you even remember how Peach looked 1 year ago?

Unfortunately, we won't be having a stand this year, but we're bringing some cool merch and surprises for you all guys, so make sure to stop any Peach member if you see them to ask for some üéÅ.
We'll see if Bitcoin keeps giving us this extremely-low-volatility while we are there, but in case you were wondering... Of course you'll be able to purchase sats using cash during the conference!

Apart from the hype BHB has on us, there are some other things we'd like to share with you, as we think they're really important and should not be dismissed.
If you follow us on twitter, you may have already seen the following tweet:

![Bity vs FINMA](https://img.mailinblue.com/5647291/images/content_library/original/64d370c9bbeb9d0cb969c1d3.png)

Alexis, is a prominent Swiss Bitcoiner, and has filled a lawsuit against FINMA, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. They want to reduce the KYC limits to a ridiculous amount, around 1.000 ‚Ç¨ / month and that kills the possibility for people using Swiss products to keep their privacy intact, while still being able to use those products in a decent way.

We've sent some sats to Alexis, and we now want to bring this to our subscribers. This issue affects all of us, and in case you can spend some sats (or fiat) to help Alexis prepare better for this battle we'll be forever grateful.

## Privacy is a human fight.

And btw... Now that we're talking about that... We've heard some people talking about a possible implementation of BIP47 (Reusable Payment Codes, commonly known as PayNyms) on Peach...üëÄ
What do you think peaches? Could BIP47 be a good fit for us? Let us know what you think by commenting on this tweet:
