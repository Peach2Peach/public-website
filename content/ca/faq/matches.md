# Matches FAQ

:::details How does Peach Matchmaking work?

Peach connects you with another Bitcoin Buyer or Seller according to your preferences of currencies and payment methods.
Based on this, Peach notifies you when you receive matching offers.
We sort the matches by [reputation score](/faq/account/#what-does-the-peach-score-mean) and price of the offer.

:::details When is the price of the trade set?

When the buyer matches an offer.
The seller may accept this match or not.

:::details As a buyer, can I match multiple sellers?

Yes! You can match as many sellers as you want. Matching a seller doesn't guarantee that they'll match you back, so it's often smart to match as many as possible. You will make the trade with the first seller that matches you back, while the other ones will need to look for new buyers.
