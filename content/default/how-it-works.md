### Not your keys, not your coins

The app has an easy to use wallet that you control built in, or you can use your existing wallet. Stick to the basics or make it hardcore - you're always in control.

<!--[security]-->

### Super secure

Peach uses Multi-Signature bitcoin addresses to make sure that the correct party can get the bitcoin if something goes wrong during the trade.

<!--[difference]-->

### What makes Peach different from other exchanges?

With Peach, you don't buy from or sell to us.
You interact directly with other peers!
This makes trading bitcoin more private and allows you to use any payment method that you can agree upon.
Our mission is to make this as easy and safe as possible.
