# How to buy and sell Bitcoin with cash using Peach

Disclaimer: The process to add a new meetup as a payment method is the same for both buyer and seller. Once the meetup is added, both
counterparts need to follow the usual Peach process to publish their trade and find a trading partner.

## Intro

Dear peachies, in today‚Äôs tutorial we‚Äôll explain how Peach users can trade with cash using the Peach app.

Peach provides ‚Äúmeeting points‚Äù for users where it is recommended to trade with cash, for security reasons. This meeting points are already

Alright, no more boring explanations, let‚Äôs get to the tutorial.

When a user wants to buy Bitcoin with cash on Peach, this steps need to be followed to publish an offer and find a match:

0.  Open the Peach app üòâ

1.  When in the **BUY** or **SELL** tab, the user will need to choose between remote / meetups payment method. In this case, when we tap on
    meetups, we‚Äôll see we can ‚Äú**add a new meetup**‚Äù.

2.  Once we‚Äôve clicked on ‚Äúadd new meetup‚Äù, a full list of the available **Countries** will appear on the app. Choose your desired country, and
    then you‚Äôll see the full list of **meetups** available in that country.

4.  After adding it, you‚Äôll see a notification warning you to trade responsibly with cash, as Peach cannot be the responsible in case something
    goes wrong with those trades.

5.  After accepting it, you‚Äôll have added successfully the meetup into your payment methods list, and you‚Äôll be able to proceed with publishing
    the buy/sell offer as you‚Äôd normally do with any other payment method in Peach.
