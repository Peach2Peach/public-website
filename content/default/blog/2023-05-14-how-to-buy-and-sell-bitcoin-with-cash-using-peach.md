# How to buy and sell Bitcoin with cash using Peach

Disclaimer: The process to add a new meetup as a payment method is the same for both buyer and seller. Once the meetup is added, both
counterparts need to follow the usual Peach process to publish their trade and find a trading partner.

## Intro

Dear peachies, in today‚Äôs tutorial we‚Äôll explain how Peach users can trade with cash using the Peach app.
