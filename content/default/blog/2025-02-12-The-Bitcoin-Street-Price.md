# The Bitcoin Street Price

Hi Peaches🍑,
 

If you read this newsletter you already probably know that peer-to-peer marketplaces facilitate direct transactions between individuals, often resulting in a “street price” for Bitcoin that reflects real-world supply and demand dynamics.

Unlike peer-to-peer markets, where buyers and sellers trade directly, traditional exchanges - even the Bitcoin only ones - act as intermediaries, managing custody, order matching, and price discovery. But do people, like you and I, who just wanna casually stack some Sats, need those intermediaries?

Now I can tell you a little story about Peach ideation process. It started in 2019. I was really bored, mentally under-challenged at my fiat job. And in the meantime that was the peak of my Bitcoin obsession. I attended meetups, conferences, joined Bitcoin twitter, telegram group, I was listening to podcasts, reading stuffs, thinking about a future where Bitcoin fixes the money… so naturally I ended up making the rational choice of aligning my energy with my financial activity. Let’s create something on Bitcoin and leave this boring fiat job. As anyone who wanna start building a company, I asked myself: what problem do I want to solve? The answer came very easily. Number 1 problem, in my opinion, before even custody bitcoin the good way, it’s to buy bitcoin the good way. In 2019, when I started the ideation process, I initially worked on a broker model. Then I realized:


1. **I would need a bank account to receive people’s fiat money**
2. **I would need to buy bitcoin as a company to be able to serve my clients. No and no. Too much headaches. And dealing with banks… no, thanks.**

  The solution? Just provide a **peer-to-peer marketplace** where:
- **I wouldn’t need a bank account**
- **I would be custodian of anyone’s fund.**

And Peach was born! Peach the company was created in February 2022 in Switzerland, **without a bank account and in bitcoin!** To this date, we don’t interact with the banking system. Peach received investments in bitcoin, pay its employees in bitcoin, get its revenue in bitcoin. Peer-to-peer business model made it possible to be **one of the first company to fully operate on a bitcoin standard.** What’s not to like about that? LFG 🍑🚀

Alright so now going back to the Bitcoin street price… aka the peer-to-peer price!!! I call it the raw price, the pure price, the intermediate-free price, the natural price, the innocent price… the price at which an individual decides that at this exact moment in time, in this exact place and in this exact situation, Bitcoin is worth <X> to him/her.

The concept of the Bitcoin street price isn’t entirely new. Back in 2017, Clark Moody introduced the [Bitcoin Street Price](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/posts/introducing-bitcoin-street-price?) index, aiming to track Bitcoin’s value as traded peer-to-peer in various local currencies. This initiative sought to provide a more accurate representation of Bitcoin’s cash value across different regions. Unfortunately this data doesn’t exist anymore due to lack of support and resources but platforms like Peach Bitcoin continue to champion the idea, that the peer-to-peer price is the real price of Bitcoin.

CHECK NOW our brand [new website home page](https://peachbitcoin.com/) to discover the Bitcoin street price ATH on Peach for the last 24h / 15d / 30d in EUR CHF USD.
How it’s calculated: we take the average price of all completed transactions on Peach.

Now look what peer2peer also means in real life:

People are trading bitcoin super anonymously with CASH while attending Bitcoin meetups! This is a French meetup below, [Bitcoin Metz!](https://x.com/btc_metz/status/1883220185504727229?s=46) Shout out to them! Peach facilitates the trade by providing the escrow and the offer discovery platform! Thanks to BitcoinMetz for presenting Peach! A true honor for us.
