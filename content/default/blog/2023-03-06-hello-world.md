# Hello World

There is a saying “Don’t ask what Bitcoin can do for you - ask what you can do for Bitcoin”.

I spent the first few years of my Bitcoin journey discovering the
protocol, the network and the asset. I let myself wander around in
both meatspace and cyberspace. This exploratory phase often
triggered my imagination. The wow moment wasn’t when I
understood the basics of how Bitcoin works, the real wow moment
was when I mapped the whole system in my head and started to
touch upon the consequences of what “Fix the money, Fix the world”
would entail.

As I embrace the beauty of human nature and the human condition,
I fell in love with Bitcoin. Raw humanity. Pure humanity where
natural laws prevail. May the strongest win thanks to the value he or
she brings to the world. May you benefit and suffer from the
consequences of your actions. Only then will you receive the signal
back from nature and will you grow. I despise unfair winners created
and fueled by the at system. I deeply despise the injustice of the
fiat system.

And so I started to build on Bitcoin from a place of hate for the ever
degenerating at civilization and from a place of love for Nature.
However, hate doesn’t create. Only love can create. In other words:
the love to build better has to be stronger than the hate to destroy
harder. This quest for developing the better version of myself and
for being part of a higher level of civilization is the ultimate and most
elevated goal I could ever try to pursue. I want to be part of the
Bitcoin revolution. Do my part at my own individual level, as little
and insignificant as it may be. I want to align my time and energy
with economic incentives based on a standard of Hope.

Individual and purposeful actions are also the basic building blocks
of praxeology in Austrian economics. Individual actions create the
whole. This is not about belief, this is a humble deductive science
that does not predict, but analyse what is.

What is the problem I can help to solve as a pragmatic and product-oriented person?
Well, the biggest problem here is quite simple to me:
how do we get bitcoin in the hands of the people?
How do people acquire bitcoin?
Where and how do they buy it?
Where do they get off 0?

Now that the problem to solve is defined, let’s look at the solution.

I looked at the on/off ramp market. A lot of big centralized
exchanges: meh, they’re for traders, not for me, not for my friends.
Cash app and Strike? Extremely cool but not available where I live,
in Europe. Alright what do I have left? Relai, Pocket, GetBittr? Very
cool too, but they require too much interaction with the banking
system for my taste, as they receive the user’s at money in their
bank account. What else? Bisq, HODL HODL, robosats, Local
Bitcoin. Love them, but I find them hard to use.

My decision was a no-brainer: the market has a huge gap to build
more and to build better in the peer-to-peer category. The
opportunity is as big as the elephant in the room, and the untapped
addressable market is pretty much the whole population!
Peer-to-peer allows one to create an on-ramp without having to
hold any funds. Neither the at, nor the bitcoins. That’s my type of
business! Bitcoins go straight to people’s wallet. I “just” have to
focus on building a user-oriented product. The vision was set and I
wrote the first peach paper laying down the big principles. That’s
when I realized that we could make P2P cooler and even more
efficient than centralized exchanges. Let’s make Stacking Sats P2P
the Standard!

Ideas are great but on their own are worth nothing. Implementation only
matters and this is definitely not a solo project. On January 1st
2021, a random group of EU plebs from Twitter started a very small
telegram group. Looking back on it, it seems like this group was
created by the help of a magic invisible hand; it was made up
exclusively of low key plebs and we never really interacted with
each other before. Yet, somehow, we ended up together in this
group and hit it off!

One day, on March 15th, 2021, I shared the first Peach paper with
those plebs. And, just like that, I found my co-founders: @czino,
@bitcoinlabrador. The Peach telegram group was created on April
22nd, 2021. We started brainstorming, working on the first mock-up,
drafting the technical requirements. On January 9th, 2022 it was
time for us to meet in real life for the first time to see if this shit was
real or not. I came back home after a week, immediately quit my fiat
job and went all in.

The company was created on February 23rd, 2022. In April, we got
Peach on Android and iPhone for the first time: the idea became a
real life product! In June, the Bitcoin VC Ten31 and a few angel
investors supported us in our mission to make stacking sats P2P
the standard. We have been building the app relentlessly since
then! We grew and doubled the team, we attracted an amazing
community to support us, got thousands of users to test our app in
a close beta environment, validated the product market fit.... And we
are just getting started!

Peach is a simple fruit and I am a simple woman. I just want to help
people who chose the orange pill. Peach has no pretenses, it’s just
delivering the proof of work required for becoming the best gateway
for your grandma, your mum, your daughter and your granddaughter.
And for you!

Peach is not just a product, but also my individualistic journey to
reach the best version of myself. Some people will join Peach
because they align with my values. But the mass who will use
Peach will do so because it’s the best product at their disposal.
