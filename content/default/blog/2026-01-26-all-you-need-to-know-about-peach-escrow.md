An escrow service is an arrangement in which a trusted third party handles the exchange of goods or assets between the transacting parties, ensuring safety and fair trading. Peach Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer trading market where you can safely trade Bitcoin in exchange for your local currency. Peach’s escrow service safeguards every transaction, giving traders peace of mind. 

Once the buyer places an order, the seller send its bitcoin to the temporary address that is Peach escrow. The bitcoin will be held in guarantee until the transaction is successfully completed by the buyer.

## How Does the Peach Bitcoin Escrow Service Work?

**Step 1: Place your order&#160;**

Place an order to buy or sell bitcoin. The bitcoin will be held by a multi-signature address between Peach Bitcoin and the seller temporarily until the buyer's operation is successfully completed.

**Step 2: Coordinate in the chat&#160;**

Start a conversation with the seller or buyer. When you are trading with a counterpart and there is the slightest doubt about the operation, we recommend that you use the chat to communicate with him/her. The chat history will be essential if there is a dispute with your counterpart and you make an appeal. 

**Step 3: Make the payment or release the bitcoin**

If you are a buyer, make the payment and notify the seller that you completed the payment. Slide the "I made the payment" button to notify the seller that you made the payment. If you are a seller, wait for the buyer's payment confirmation before releasing the bitcoin.

**Step 4: The transaction was successful or the trade partner was not responding**

In most cases, when everything goes smoothly, the buyer pays and the seller releases the bitcoin, but what happens if the counterpart was not fair? In other words, the buyer did not transfer the money or the seller did not release the bitcoin after the buyer made the payment. 

In these cases you need to open an appeal, click on the [dispute](https://peachbitcoin.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-peach-disputes/) button. Now is when the escrow service comes into play and this is why the bitcoin was temporarily held.

## How Does the Peach Escrow Service Help Sellers? 

If the bitcoin buyer did not make the payment, Peach's escrow service will give the seller the choice to get refunded or to publish the escrowed bitcoin to a new offer when the time for negotiation is over

## How Does the Peach Escrow Service Help Buyers?

If the buyer made the payment but the seller did not release the bitcoin, the buyer can open an appeal to notify Peach's mediators service that the counterparty did not release the bitcoin. If you are the buyer, please provide as much evidence as you can, a receipt of payment, or screenshots of the conversation you had with the seller, and once our customer service confirms the payment is made, the bitcoin will be handed to the buyer after 30 days. This is because the escrow has an expiring multisig after 4320 blocks.

Remember, this situation is highly unlikely because a seller adopting an uncooperative strategy is guaranteed to not win anything, and lose his reputation. The escrow ensures that scammers have no way of profiting from the system.

## Why Is the Escrow Service Important?

The escrow service protects Peach users from scammers. If a user tries to convince you to make a deal outside the Peach platform, ignore the suggestion and open an appeal. If you make a deal outside the platform we cannot protect you.  

Imagine that you want to buy bitcoin and you find an offer at a competitive price but the seller seems new to the platform, with zero completed trades. How can you be sure that the seller will transfer the bitcoin to your wallet? 

The escrow service aims to solve this type of situation, by holding the bitcoin in a transitory address, where the seller is no longer the only one in control. Peach also has its word to say. When there is no agreement and the counterpart opens an appeal, Peach customer service will analyze both the buyer's and the seller's stories. If the buyer wins the appeal, the bitcoin will be released to his wallet. However, if he loses the appeal, the bitcoin will go back at the seller’s disposition. 

While the bitcoin is in the escrow, users can trade safely without the risk of losing money, whatever amount of money you trade.
