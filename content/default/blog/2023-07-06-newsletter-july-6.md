# Newsletter July 6th

Hello Peaches! üçë

July is here, and the market knows it. 

Even if Bitcoin never stops entering blocks every 10 minutes, like a crazy psychopath, we're so lucky to be able to stop for a while and contemplate what we've achieved during the first half of this 2023 year.

From the Peach team, we'd like to encourage all of you to take a break from time to time, to look around you, and to simply appreciate where you are. Did you think you'd be here one year ago?

This little moment of introspection can give us the forces we need to simply keep pushing. One block at a time; no need to rush.

In case you're not stopping even during the summer, we bring a good opportunity for you to stack a few sats ü§ë 

We've been working with [Apollo](https://heyapollo.com) to allow our users to leave reviews about Peach and earn rewards for those reviews!

In case you don't know about them, [Apollo](https://heyapollo.com) is a great platform where users can publish reviews about their favorite (or most-hated) products, and earn some sats in the process‚ö°

We'll leave the link in the button below, where you can earn sats by leaving a Peach review!

Apart from that, we've integrated an [Apollo](https://heyapollo.com) widget on our website, and the user reviews will be seen directly from there.

Their platform has helped many bitcoiners know if a product is good before even trying it.

And the sats you can earn just by publishing your review are not the only ones... We can also directly zap some sats to the reviews that we like the most!üçë

We'd love to see some of your reviews, so we encourage you to try Apollo, earn some sats, and keep helping other bitcoiners know which are the best products out there!

V4V is the way.
