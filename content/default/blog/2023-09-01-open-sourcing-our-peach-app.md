# Open sourcing our Peach App

Hey there,

Today is a day that's got us all kinds of excited! We're here to spill the beans (or should we say peaches?) ‚Äì the Peach App is taking a big step into the open source world. It's been a journey, and we've been holding onto this secret like a surprise party you just can't wait to throw.

You might be wondering, why the wait? Well, think about it like this: just like a cake needs time to bake to perfection, we wanted to make sure the Peach App was ready to shine before we let it out into the wild world of open source.

Big moves like this gave us concern about copycats. You know, those folks with deep pockets and fancy developers who might want to snatch our peachy idea. By giving our app some quality time behind the scenes, we've made sure it's strong enough to stand its ground.

And here it is, our [Peach App repository](https://github.com/Peach2Peach/peach-app), publicly visible to everyone!

Now, let's talk licenses ‚Äì we've gone with the MIT-CC route. What does that mean? Well, it means you can peek under the hood and check out the gears and gadgets that make the Peach App tick. But it also means others can't just swoop in and turn our hard work into their cash cow. We're keeping it personal, and we think that's just peachy.

That said however, we are splitting out chunks of code and provide them under a true open source license. Being FOSS, anyone can fork this code and build on top of it or modify it to their needs. This currently includes the brand new [GroupHug server code](https://github.com/Peach2Peach/groupHug) as well as a [Peach API-Wrapper written in TypeScript](https://github.com/Peach2Peach/peach-api-ts). We will keep adding new projects under this category as well.

So, why are we spilling the code beans now? Here's the scoop:

**1. Security:** You know how they say many hands make light work? It's true for security too. With open source, more folks can dig into the code, spot any quirks, and keep the Peach App super secure.

**2. We're Putting Our Money Where Our Mouth Is:** Privacy is our jam, and we're inviting you to see it for yourself. Open source means you can dive into the nitty-gritty and see that we're not just talking the talk ‚Äì we're walking the walk.

**3. No More Blind Trust:** Trust falls are fun, but not when it comes to bitcoin apps. By sharing our code, we're letting you double-check that we're sticking to our promises. You're in control, and that's the way it should be.

Oh and we are also [Making our Peach-API Public](/blog/2023-09-01-making-our-peach-api-public.md). So if you want to skip the app altogether and use our API directly, you can [find our documentation here](https://docs.peachbitcoin.com/#introduction).
So, here's to this new adventure! The Peach App is taking its first open source steps, and you're right here with us. It's not a full transformation, but it's a step that's filled with collaboration, transparency, and a lot of that sweet Peach charm.

Big thanks for sticking by us. Let's make the Peach App's next chapter the juiciest one yet!
