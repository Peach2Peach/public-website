## What is an Order Book?
The Order Book is a tool that collects all the offers to buy and sell a given asset, in this case Bitcoin, on our platform. It is like a virtual bulletin board that shows in real time the intentions of users to buy or sell BTC, without the need to provide personal information (KYC-Free).

# What is the Peach Bitcoin Order Book and how does it work?
If you are new to Bitcoin trading, you have probably heard of a fundamental concept: the Order Book. But what exactly is it and how does it work, especially within our KYC-Free ecosystem on Peach Bitcoin? In this article, we will explore everything you need to know.

### Sell Offers

Users looking to sell Bitcoin place their offers by specifying the quantity, price and terms of sale. All offers are visible in real time in the Order Book, ready for buyers to explore. Our Order Book structure, with only sales offers, reduces complexity and allows for more intuitive navigation. Users know exactly what to expect and can quickly move through the offers to find the best deal available.

Buyers can easily find the ideal offer thanks to the available filters. You can sort offers by:

**Lowest Premium:**  Find offers with the Lowest premiums, ideal for those looking to sell at the maximum profit above the market price.

**Best Reputation:**  Sort offers by seller reputation, ensuring you are trading with highly rated and reliable users.

**Highest Amount:**  Filter offers to find those with the highest amount of Bitcoin available, perfect for those looking to buy in large volumes.

**Highest Price:**  Sort by price to find offers that match the value you are willing to pay.
