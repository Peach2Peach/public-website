# Peach v69 is here! Say hello to faster trades, more control, and a better way to stack sats

I started Peach because I wanted to buy Bitcoin the right way: privately, easily, without handing over my ID or my coins. But the tools I found were either too technical, too clunky, or just didn’t feel made for someone like me.

Since then, we’ve been building Peach to offer a better alternative. And today, we’re launching **version 69**, our biggest product update yet, and a meaningful step forward for the app and our users.

## What’s new in v69

Until now, only sellers could post offers on Peach. That worked, and it got us here. But it was always a limitation. Buyers had to wait for what was available, scroll through options, and hope for the right price.

**With v69, buyers can now post offers too**. That means both sides can now set the terms, creating a true two-way marketplace. More matches. More liquidity. Less waiting around.

We called it v69 because it’s symbolic as trades now flows in both directions.

## What this means for the product

- **Buyers can post offers just like sellers**: set your price, choose your payment method, and let sellers match with you.

- **It’s faster and more flexible**: you’re not stuck waiting in trade limbo. More offers means better chances to trade on your terms.

- **The app feels cleaner and sharper**: we’ve updated the design, tightened the flow, and made things smoother all around.

- **Everything that matters stays the same**: no KYC. No custody. You hold your keys. You store your account locally. Your chats are encrypted. That doesn’t change.

## Why this matters

This update brings us closer to what we’ve always aimed for: a real peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange, made for mobile, with no compromises.

It gives more power to our users. Especially new ones who want a better alternative to centralised exchanges but don’t want to deal with technical tools or unfamiliar interfaces.

We’re now doing over **500,000 CHF in monthly trade volume**, with consistent retention and word-of-mouth growth. We haven’t raised a big round, and we don’t run big campaigns. We’ve just built, listened, and improved. And I’m proud to say that thanks to the support and believe from our growing user base, it’s working! 

## Looking ahead

v69 is the foundation for everything that comes next. It opens the door to more liquidity, more trust, and more scale: across regions, use cases, and users. We’re continuing to invest in the things that matter most:

- Better onboarding

- A more polished experience

- And expanding access for people who want to buy Bitcoin the right way

Thanks to everyone who’s supported us so far: especially those of you who use Peach regularly and share honest feedback. That’s what makes this work.

If you haven’t posted a buy offer yet, now’s the time to give it a go!
