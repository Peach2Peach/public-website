# A rant - If Bitcoin Goes To 1 Million

Bitcoin is scarce. Really scarce. So absurdly scarce, that it will shock you once, twice and many dozens of times and no matter how much you think you understand the scarcity of it, the 21,000,000 will keep surprising you again and again by just how insanely scarce an absolute is. It is a first in human history, it has literally never happened before.

Bitcoiners respect this scarcity and respect the number-go-up technology that this implies. Bitcoin will keep going up and then again it will go up. Forever Laura.

So what if it reaches 100,000 or 200,000? What if it goes to 500,000 or even 1,000,000? How might the world look like?

Bitcoin is transparent. Everything in it is public information and can be seen and verified by anyone. This is what allows you to  make sure that you are not being lied to, that you can verify anything you want and can minimize the trust involved.

Bitcoin also is really empowering. Anyone who holds twelve magic words can quite literally do magic with them. Speak them and you will have the power to harness unimaginable energy according to your will.

Bitcoin ultimately puts no one in charge and by doing so, it leaves you with the responsibility.

So what if it does reach a million? What if it does and everyone and their dog knows you have it and how much you have. Anybody can see where you spend it, when you spend it, how you spend it and what you spend it on. The powers that be might not like some of these things and oops! now you have a problem. It is your responsibility to be aware of the risks involved that radical transparency exposes you to. If Bitcoin goes to the moon but you can no longer spend it as you wish it stops being a magic harness of energy and instead becomes a magic harness on you.

Even worse, if you never even take the power to harness it into your own hands, if you don’t take custody of it, others will do so on your part. Your million that you now have will have lost its purpose completely. You will simply be the fattest pig in the slaughterhouse.

This is what it means for Bitcoin to be decentralized and for you to be sovereign and to take responsibility. No one is going to do it for you. But if you want to, the door is open. For now. Use it while you can, take the risk and take the lead. If you don’t take the lead on your life, others will. If Bitcoin goes to a million but you don’t have the ability to do with it what you want, what will you have gained? If your every move is monitored what will a million give you? Don’t let potential go to waste, don’t give up the power over what is yours. Use it, defend it and for this to happen, first of all: Recognize it!

Bitcoin will go to 100,000. It will go to 200,000 and 500,000. And yes, at one point it will even go to 1,000,000.

Focus not on where the price will go but instead focus on how you will go along with it, what this ride will look like and how you want to partake in it. A number will not change your freedom or sovereignty. Only individual responsibility and the tools you use to strengthen it will. Take it or leave it. But you will pay the price and reap the reward either way.

Your truly,
Mr. Dot
