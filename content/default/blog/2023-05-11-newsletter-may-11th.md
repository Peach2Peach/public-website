Hello Peaches!
How is your sats stacking going? Even in this monkey-jpegs-powered high fees situation, if you've got some more sats than 2 weeks ago, you're doing a good job. As you'll see in our market stats section, our users have not relaxed their aim to stack sats even in this situation!
We know it's not pleasant at all to pay for such high fees on-chain, so that's why today we bring some news about our future plans.
Our mission is to make stacking sats P2P the standard, and we're doing it by allowing our users to trade in a friction-less way.
To do so, we've started planning different ways that will allow our users to keep stacking sats, without the need to spend ridiculous amounts of money on fees.
Currently we're already batching some transactions manually, but the idea is to do this automatically in the future. This will lead to savings of up to 20%!
And that's not the only option we're pondering! But you'll need to wait a little bit more until we bring those features to our app (soon TM).
Anyway, let's talk about something a bit more fun. As you may know, we started a series of blog posts aimed to help users understand the importance of P2P. We'll keep you up to date about every new blogpost in this newsletter, to make sure you don't miss any of them.
Help us share the P2P word with the whole world by sharing it with your newbie friends!
