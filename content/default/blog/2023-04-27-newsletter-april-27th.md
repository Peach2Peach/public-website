  Bitcoin is money for free people. We believe that every single human being has the right to choose which money he uses to store his wealth, the
  result of his work, his time and energy.
  Peach’s mission is to do its part to contribute to Bitcoin’s adoption in the hands of the people.

Hello Peaches!
Welcome to our first newsletter. We will keep sending updates about peach, market stats, and other things that we think can provide value to you!
In this first newsletter, we want to share a few things…
We've started a series of blog posts aimed to help users understand the importance of P2P. We'll keep sending the new blog posts that we publish in this newsletter, to make sure you don't miss any of them.
Help us share the P2P word with the whole world by sharing it with your newbie friends!
In the first post we dig into the origins of Bitcoin, and why we almost lost the path that Satoshi brought to the world.
