## Yearly analysis of the best moment to stack sats

Hello Peaches! 🍑
Did you know Wednesday was the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere? That means from now on, until Christmas, you'll have a little less daylight each day to stack sats.

Luckily for you, Peach works during the night, so you can match offers whenever you feel like doing so 😉.

Diving a little deeper into solstices and the length of days, we did some extensive research with the best experts in the field, to give you our advice on the best season of the year to stack sats.

As you can see, NOW is exactly the best moment to stack stats!💸

(make sure to re-read this statement every day)

Jokes apart, summer is officially starting, and good vibes are felt all around.

We also want to bring some good news to all of you for this summer season, and as some of you may have already seen, we've been updating the app to include some long-awaited functionalities.

In case you haven't updated yet, don't get left behind! Peach 0.2.9 includes the following improvements:

    Update bdk-rn (peach wallet foundation)
    Funding from peach wallet
    Improved app startup time
    Peach en français! 🇲🇫
    featured events/meetups
    French PM: no fees for a month (from 21.06 on)
    ...

 

You read that right! Peach en Français and the French Payment Methods are exempt of fees for one full month🤑

For all of you who are in France, do not lose this opportunity to stack cheaper sats in your local payment methods!

Since launching the app in Spanish and French, we've been receiving submissions to help us translate the app into different local languages.

The next ones in the line are Italian and German, which are almost finished, but in case you would like to contribute to translating the app into your local language (and earn some sats in the process), we'd be more than happy to hear from you.
 
We're looking for any European language at first, and later expanding to the rest of the world.

## Market Stats
from 06/09 to 06/22

Down here you'll find a recap of the most important stats from the previous weeks. Let us know if you'd like to see any chart/metric that doesn't appear here.

TL;DR: We've seen a spike on sellers during the past weeks, we love seeing people stop using VEXs to sell their Bitcoin, and bringing liquidity to the real market.

UK market has seen a spike of trades using Faster Payments.🇬🇧
