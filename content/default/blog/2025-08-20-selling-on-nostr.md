# Selling on Peach = Selling on Nostr!

Great news everyone! As of today, whenever you publish a Bitcoin Sell Offer on Peach it gets automatically announced on Nostr!

## Wait, why posting it on Nostr?

As you may know, Nostr is a decentralized social media platform, where users generate a private/public key pair and immediately participate, posting their thoughts, pictures, whatever they want! Because it is decentralized, it is immune to control and censorship.
But what if you can post more than your thoughts?
With this [improvement](https://nips.nostr.com/69) Nostr now supports sharing Peer-to-Peer Orders to be published. Do you see it as a regular user? Not immediately, because these are specific Nostr Events ( event type 38383 ), a type of event created specifically to keep this type of content separate from “normal” stuff. However, to the ones who are listening for 38383 events, they will know that a new Bitcoin Sell Offer was created on Peach. Check out [p2p.band](https://p2p.band/) and scroll for Peach offers!

## What’s so cool about this?

Well, first of all: people don’t need to be using their Peach App to be aware that there is a new Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer purchase opportunity. This gives a voice to Peach users and the Peach Community!
Second: this is a censorship-free platform! This means that everyone that wants to listen IS listening! If someone wants to buy Bitcoin, they can just sit back, listen on Nostr and then go to Peach.

This is yet another step for Bitcoin, Nostr and Peach: the decentralized world, censorship-resistant, is proving yet again to provide unity and communication instead of separation.
