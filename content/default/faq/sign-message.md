   - Paste it into the Peach app when prompted.

**Confirm and Copy the Verification Message**  
   - After confirming your address in the Peach app, youâ€™ll see a message that you need to verify.  
   - Copy this text (it will be used for signing).

**Sign the Message in Sparrow Wallet**

   - Paste your Bitcoin address and the message text from the Peach app.

**Generate the Signature**

> **Note:** Not all wallets allow message signing. BlueWallet and Sparrow Wallet both have this functionality, and the process is similar in both.

> **Note 2:** You only need to sign once for each address you intend to use for receiving Bitcoin. Otherwise, you can always receive in your Peach wallet and withdraw to any address without additional signing.
