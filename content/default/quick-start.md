## Intro: Why Peach and why peer-to-peer?

On a “normal” centralized exchanges, you buy bitcoin from the company directly. That often makes it pretty easy, but you do need to upload your identity documents, which could be leaked when the exchange gets hacked, and is generally bad for privacy. The company also becomes a honey pot… holding all your privacy documents, knowing how much you bought/sold bitcoin.. and you have to trust them that they won't ever report you to “an authority”. Last, on centralized  exchanges, you don’t own your bitcoin but you are holding an account at the company. You might know that gold was massively confiscated with [executive order 6102](https://river.com/learn/terms/e/executive-order-6102/) and you don't want the same to happen to your sacred bitcoin. 

So on the other hand of centralized exchanges, **there are peer to peer exchanges**. Here you can buy and sell from/to other people, which is better for your privacy in a lot of ways. But, those platforms can be pretty complicated to use… **until now**!

Peach is very **accessible**, easy to use.. **even for your GrandMa**, it's more **private**, has **more payment methods** and you're buying **real bitcoin straight to a wallet that YOU control**, not some exchange note that they may or may not pay out. Here's how it works:

## Guide 1: Setting up the app

After you've installed the app (through the [App Store]($iosUrl$), [Play Store]($androidUrl$) or [APK download](/apk/)) or [Zap Store](https://zapstore.dev/), you're pretty much already done.
The only thing required from you right now is a referral code - if you have one.

You'll then be met by a quick three-step explainer on how Peach works.

![](/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/1.png)
You'll be asked if you want to share some data with us

![](/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/new.png)
After that, you'll be asked if you have a referral code. If you don't - don't worry about it

![](/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/usage-data.png)
That's it! You're good to go!

This quick setup process does mean that **you're not yet backed up**. You'll be asked to [create a backup and a password](/faq/account/#how-should-i-store-my-backup) after you've completed your first trade.

## Guide 7: Set-up an instant-trade when creating a BUY or a SELL offer

When creating a buy or sell offer, there is the option to “instant-trade” . It means that you will NOT have to accept a trade request. In other words, the counterparty will be able to get into a trade with you automatically. It is great for faster trading because the buyer will have one hour to make the payment instead of 12 and the seller will have 1 hour to deposit in escrow instead of 12

:::quickstarts 7
![](/img/faq/quickstart/069-screenshots/instant-trade/buy.png)

![](/img/faq/quickstart/069-screenshots/instant-trade/sell.png)
This is how you set it in a sell offer

![](/img/faq/quickstart/069-screenshots/instant-trade/filter-sell.png)
