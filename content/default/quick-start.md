## Intro: Why Peach?

On a normal exchange, you buy bitcoin from them directly. That often makes it pretty easy, but you do need to upload your identity documents, which could be leaked when the exchange gets hacked, and is generally bad for privacy.

On the other hand, there are peer to peer exchanges. Here you can buy from other people, which is better for your privacy in a lot of ways. But, they can be pretty complicated to use… until now!

Peach is **easy** to use, it's more **private** , has **more payment methods** and you're buying _**real**_ **bitcoin** , not some exchange note that they may or may not pay out. Here's how it works:

## Guide 1: Setting up the app

After you've installed the app (through the [App Store]($iosUrl$), [Play Store]($androidUrl$) or [APK download](/apk/)), you're pretty much already done.
The only thing required from you right now is a referral code - if you have one.

![You'll then be met by a quick three-step explainer on how Peach works.](/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/1.png)

![After that, you'll be asked if you have a referral code. If you don't - don't worry about it 😉](/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/new.png)

![That's it! You're good to go!](/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/created.png)

This quick setup process does mean that **you're not yet backed up**. You'll be asked to [create a backup and a password](/faq/account/#how-should-i-store-my-backup) after you've completed your first trade.

## Guide 2: Your first buy offer

Placing your first buy offer can be done in just a few seconds. You'll just need to tell us how much you want to buy, and how you want to pay your seller.

Here's the step by step of your first buy offer:

:::figures 5
![You'll first select how much you want to buy. This is always a range, and you'll be shown all sell offers available in that range.](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer1.png)

![You'll then need to tell us how you want to pay. If you want to know more about payment methods, you should [read this guide](#guide-4-adding-payment-methods). At the end, you can come right back here.](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer2.png)

![Note that you can select as many payment methods as you want, to increase your chances of a match!](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer3.png)

![After that, you'll see a quick summary, where you can check all the payment methods you selected and how much you're buying.](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer4.png)

![Your buy offer is now published! If there are sell offers available, you'll be shown them immediately. If not, you'll need to wait for a while.](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer5.png)

### Matching a seller

After publishing your buy offer, you'll be shown all the sell offers that fall within the range you selected, and that has at least one payment method in common:

![When you've selected the currency and payment method you want to use for this trade (if you have more than one in common), you can match the offer.](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer6.png)

![You'll get five seconds to undo if you change your mind. After that, the seller will be notified of their match, and unmatching now is considered a dick move (your Peach Score will be hurt)](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer7.png)

### Making the trade

![If the seller matches you back, you'll be notified & shown their payment details. You should go to your payment app and manually make the payment there. After that, you confirm that you did with the slider at the bottom, and you wait for the seller to respond (you can chit-chat in the meantime).](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer8.png)

![Once the seller confirms, the deed is done! The bitcoin amount will be sent to your wallet and you can give eachother a rating. (Assuming everything went well, of course.)](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyOffer9.png)

## Guide 3: Your first sell offer

Placing your first sell offer can be done in just a few minutes. You'll just need to tell us how much you want to sell, and how you want your buyer to pay you.

Here's the step by step of your first sell offer:

### Creating a sell offer

:::figures 7
![First, you'll select how much you want to sell. You can select any amount, but there is a maximum to prevent your offer for going over the daily limit and becoming unavailable.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep01.png)

![You'll then select if you want to offer the buyer a discount, or ask a little more than the market price.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep02.png)

![You'll then need to how you want to be paid. At the end, you can come right back here.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep03.png)

![Note that you can select as many payment methods as you want, to increase your chances of a match!](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep04.png)

![After that, you'll see a quick summary, where you can check all the payment methods you selected and how much you're selling.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep05.png)

![The last step before your sell offer is published is to fund the escrow to secure the trade. You'll send the bitcoin to this address from the wallet that you have it in right now.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep06.png)

![And that's it! After the bitcoin network has confirmed the transaction, your sell offer is published and waiting for a match.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep07.png)
:::

### Matching a buyer back

After publishing your sell offer, it will be shown to all the buyers that have at least one currency and payment method in common, and that want to buy the amount you're selling. If someone matches your offer, you'll get a notification, and you can match them back (or wait for more matches):

### Making the trade

:::figures 3
![After you've selected a match, the trade is officially made. You'll get to see from where the buyer will be making the payment, and for how much. You can also chat with your buyer should you have any questions.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep08.png)

![Once the buyer has made the payment, you should check the relevant payment account to see if you received it. If you did, you can confirm it here. Once you've confirmed you received the payment, the bitcoin will be sent to the buyer.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep09.png)

![And that's it! The bitcoin amount will be sent to the buyer and you can give eachother a rating. (Assuming everything went well, of course.](/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep10.png)

## Guide 4: Adding payment methods

When you make a buy or sell offer in Peach, you'll need to let your counterparty know how you'll pay, or want to be paid.

:::figures 7
![First, you can choose between two categories: **remote** (e.g. bank transfer, paypal) or on a **meetup** (with cash).](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM01.png)

![You'll then select which currency you want to use for this payment method.](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM02.png)

![You'll then see the categories of payment method available for this currency. We'll go with an online wallet for this example.](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM03.png)

![A drawer opens where you can select which online wallet you want to add. Let's select PayPal.](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM04.png)

![All you have to do here is fill in your details. You can also indicate if your wallet can receive any additional currencies.](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM05.png)

![Once done, you press confirm, and…](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM06.png)
