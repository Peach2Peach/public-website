## Intro: Why Peach?

On a normal exchange, you buy bitcoin from them directly. That often makes it pretty easy, but you do need to upload your identity documents, which could be leaked when the exchange gets hacked, and is generally bad for privacy.

On the other hand, there are peer to peer exchanges. Here you can buy from other people, which is better for your privacy in a lot of ways. But, they can be pretty complicated to useâ€¦ until now!

Peach is **easy** to use, it's more **private** , has **more payment methods** and you're buying _**real**_ **bitcoin** , not some exchange note that they may or may not pay out. Here's how it works:

## Guide 1: Setting up the app

After you've installed the app (through the [App Store]($iosUrl$), [Play Store]($androidUrl$) or [APK download](/apk/)) or [Zap Store](https://zapstore.dev/), you're pretty much already done.
The only thing required from you right now is a referral code - if you have one.

This quick setup process does mean that **you're not yet backed up**. You'll be asked to [create a backup and a password](/faq/account/#how-should-i-store-my-backup) after you've completed your first trade.

## Guide 2: Buy from existing offers

Here's the step by step of your first buy from existing offers:

## Guide 6: Adding payment methods

When you make a buy or sell offer in Peach, you'll need to let your counterparty know how you'll pay, or want to be paid.

First, you can choose between two categories: remote (e.g. bank transfer, paypal) or on a meetup (with cash).

![](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM02.png)
You'll then select which currency you want to use for this payment method.

![](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM03.png)
You'll then see the categories of payment method available for this currency. We'll go with an online wallet for this example

![](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM04.png)
A drawer opens where you can select which online wallet you want to add. Let's select PayPal

![](/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM05.png)
All you have to do here is fill in your details. You can also indicate if your wallet can receive any additional currencies.
