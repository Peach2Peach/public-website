## Make a buy offer

Placing your first buy offer can be done in just a few seconds. You'll just need to select how much you want to buy, and how you want to pay your seller.

Here's the step by step of your first buy offer:

### Matching a seller

After publishing your buy offer, you'll be shown all the sell offers that fall within the range you selected, and that has at least one payment method in common:

After that, you confirm that you did with the slider at the bottom, and you wait for the seller to respond (you can chit-chat in the meantime).](/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep8.png)
