<h2 id="intro-why-peach">Intro: Why Peach?</h2>
<p>On a normal exchange, you buy bitcoin from them directly. That often makes it pretty easy, but you do need to upload your identity documents, which could be leaked when the exchange gets hacked, and is generally bad for privacy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are peer to peer exchanges. Here you can buy from other people, which is better for your privacy in a lot of ways. But, they can be pretty complicated to useâ€¦ until now!</p>
<p>Peach is <strong>easy</strong> to use, it's more <strong>private</strong> , has <strong>more payment methods</strong> and you're buying <em><strong>real</strong></em> <strong>bitcoin</strong> , not some exchange note that they may or may not pay out. Here's how it works:</p>
<h2 id="guide-1-setting-up-the-app">Guide 1: Setting up the app</h2>
<p>After you've installed the app (through the <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/wfSPFEWG">App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peachbitcoin.peach.mainnet">Play Store</a> or <a href="/apk/">APK download</a>), you're pretty much already done.
The only thing required from you right now is a referral code - if you have one.</p>
<div class="figures figures--4">
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/usage-data.png" alt=""><figcaption>First you'll be asked if you want to share some data with us</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/1.png" alt=""><figcaption>You'll then be met by a quick three-step explainer on how Peach works.</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/new.png" alt=""><figcaption>After that, you'll be asked if you have a referral code. If you don't - don't worry about it ðŸ˜‰</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/onboarding/created.png" alt=""><figcaption>That's it! You're good to go!</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p>This quick setup process does mean that <strong>you're not yet backed up</strong>. You'll be asked to <a href="/faq/account/#how-should-i-store-my-backup">create a backup and a password</a> after you've completed your first trade.</p>
<h2 id="guide-2-your-first-buy-offer">Guide 2: Your first buy offer</h2>
<p>Placing your first buy offer can be done in just a few seconds. You'll just need to tell us how much you want to buy, and how you want to pay your seller.</p>
<p>Here's the step by step of your first buy offer:</p>
<div class="figures figures--5">
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep1.png" alt=""><figcaption>You'll first select how much you want to buy. This is always a range, and you'll be shown all sell offers available in that range.</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep2.png" alt=""><figcaption>You'll then need to tell us how you want to pay. If you want to know more about payment methods, you should <a href="#guide-4-adding-payment-methods">read this guide</a>. At the end, you can come right back here.</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep3.png" alt=""><figcaption>Note that you can select as many payment methods as you want, to increase your chances of a match!</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep5.png" alt=""><figcaption>Your buy offer is now published! If there are sell offers available, you'll be shown them immediately. If not, you'll need to wait for a while.</figcaption></figure>

<div class="figures figures--2">
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep6.png" alt=""><figcaption>When you've selected the currency and payment method you want to use for this trade (if you have more than one in common), you can match the offer.</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep7.png" alt=""><figcaption>You'll get five seconds to undo if you change your mind. After that, the seller will be notified of their match, and unmatching now is considered a dick move (your Peach Score will be hurt)</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="making-the-trade">Making the trade</h3>
<div class="figures figures--2">
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep8.png" alt=""><figcaption>If the seller matches you back, you'll be notified & shown their payment details. You should go to your payment app and manually make the payment there. After that, you confirm that you did with the slider at the bottom, and you wait for the seller to respond (you can chit-chat in the meantime).</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/buy/BuyStep9.png" alt=""><figcaption>Once the seller confirms, the deed is done! The bitcoin amount will be sent to your wallet and you can give eachother a rating. (Assuming everything went well, of course.)</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="guide-3-your-first-sell-offer">Guide 3: Your first sell offer</h2>
<p>Placing your first sell offer can be done in just a few minutes. You'll just need to tell us how much you want to sell, and how you want your buyer to pay you.</p>
<p>Here's the step by step of your first sell offer:</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-sell-offer">Creating a sell offer</h3>
<div class="figures figures--7">
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep01.png" alt=""><figcaption>First, you'll select how much you want to sell. You can select any amount, but there is a maximum to prevent your offer for going over the daily limit and becoming unavailable.</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep02.png" alt=""><figcaption>You'll then select if you want to offer the buyer a discount, or ask a little more than the market price.</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep03.png" alt=""><figcaption>You'll then need to how you want to be paid. At the end, you can come right back here.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep06.png" alt=""><figcaption>The last step before your sell offer is published is to fund the escrow to secure the trade. You'll send the bitcoin to this address from the wallet that you have it in right now.</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep07.png" alt=""><figcaption>And that's it! After the bitcoin network has confirmed the transaction, your sell offer is published and waiting for a match.</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="matching-a-buyer-back">Matching a buyer back</h3>
<p>After publishing your sell offer, it will be shown to all the buyers that have at least one currency and payment method in common, and that want to buy the amount you're selling. If someone matches your offer, you'll get a notification, and you can match them back (or wait for more matches):</p>

<h3 id="making-the-trade-2">Making the trade</h3>
<div class="figures figures--3">
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep08.png" alt=""><figcaption>After you've selected a match, the trade is officially made.

<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/sell/SellStep09.png" alt=""><figcaption>Once the buyer has made the payment, you should check the relevant payment account to see if you received it.

<h2 id="guide-4-adding-payment-methods">Guide 4: Adding payment methods</h2>
<p>When you make a buy or sell offer in Peach, you'll need to let your counterparty know how you'll pay, or want to be paid.</p>
<div class="figures figures--7">
<figure><img src="/img/faq/quickstart/add-payment-method/AddPM01.png" alt=""><figcaption>First, you can choose between two categories: <strong>remote</strong> (e.g. bank transfer, paypal) or on a <strong>meetup</strong> (with cash).</figcaption></figure>
